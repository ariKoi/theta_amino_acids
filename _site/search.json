    "text": "Data Source: Ref ranges - AAU file\nData Processing Steps:\nQ&A and manual data cleaning/clarity changes on the xlsx source file:\nid 40217 and 39683 have strange weight values. A: Take the average of these values.\nQ: On the variables aerobics_times_per_week and resistance_times_per_week, some ids have a check mark and two ids have strange values. What is the actual meaning? A: It means that in the survey form the person just said that they are exercising without specifying how many times per week. I have coded such cases with the value of 100 so that column remains of numeric type. However I change this, see here a bit further below. Also if the value was 3-4 meaning 3 or 4 times per weeks, I converted this to 3.5. Similarly for other ranges i.e. 1-2 = 1.5\nQ: What is the meaning of aerobics_duration_min? There are 4 much larger values than the rest. A: This is the duration that the person exercises per time/exercise session.\nFor ids: 41685 1210 39817 39517 changes of column aerobics_duration_min from 60120 to 90 (i.e. average) from 3040 to 35 from 4550 to 47.5 from 1520 to 17.5\nBMI is weight/height^2 kg_per_m2, no need to be calculated in the excel source file as it is calculated after the data are imported. Also deleted empty columns in between non-empty ones. Note also the column names and the structure rearrangement on the exercise related columns. From the column name Glycine μmol/g crea removed the “crea”. Changed the name of Glutamic Acid μmol/g to Glutamate μmol/g. For the aerobics_times_per_week column there are 2 values of 45353 45385 of ids 25983 44856 which I coded as 100 i.e. they exercise but without a specific number.\nWith regards to the 100 valued cases on the exercise related columns: If aerobics_times_per_week is checked but the corresponding aerobics_duration_min column had a missing value i.e. no exercise duration, then the aerobics_times_per_week value is 0 i.e. no exercise. For the similar cases but with aerobics_duration_min having a non-zero value, then the value is checked manually and an expected value is chosen i.e. 30-45 min per week probably means once a week the person is exercising. Similarly for the resistance_times_per_week / resistance_duration_min pair of columns.\nA new columns named chronic_disease_v2 was created that is based on the chronic_disease column. It is a recoded version of the chronic_disease column having more general categories of disease in order to ease interpretation and to increase the sample size for each disease category. Information was also utilized from the meds column for cases where the chronic_disease value was missing but the meds value was not. Medicine names and their relation to a disease type were checked via search engine.\nchronic_disease_v2 is additionally lumped by frequency into 8 levels into a new column named chronic_disease_v3.\nThe column supplements has not been yet recoded as it contains a variety of vitamins and proteins. If desired, the column could be recoded towards a more specific use case i.e. effect of magnesium.\nFor later runs, perhaps 2 more changes can be made in the excel source file:\n\nRemove the Creatinine column since not needed.\nRemove the mark ‘μmol/g’ from the amino acid column names.\n\nThe above steps result in the data table output that can be found here and which is then used to proceed with the below changes and the modeling (reference interval construction).\nOnce the data is imported, the following flag/indicator (Yes/No) variables are created: chronic_disease_flag, meds_flag and supplements_flag.\nMissing values are replaced by zeroes on all of the amino acids and on these variables: aerobics_times_per_week, aerobics_duration_min, resistance_times_per_week and resistance_duration_min. These latter 4 variables are removed after being merged to the 2 following in order to create general exercise activity variables: aerobics_activity = aerobics_times_per_week * aerobics_duration_min\nresistance_activity = resistance_times_per_week * resistance_duration_min\naerobics_activity and resistance_activity are log transformed.\nThe final data set that will be used for modeling and exploratory data analysis is shown below, together with its statistical descriptions.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinuousCategorical\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRef_ranges_AAU_2 Descriptives\n\n\n17 Continous Variables of 27 Variables, 308 Observations\n\n\nVariable\nLabel\nUnits\nn\nMissing\nDistinct\nInfo\nMean\nGini |Δ|\n\nQuantiles\n .05  .10  .25  .50  .75  .90  .95 \n\n\n\n\nage\nAge\nyears\n274\n34\n62\n0.999\n43.33\n15.35\n\n\n 20.0  26.3  34.0  43.0  53.0  61.0  65.7 \n\n\nweight_kg\nSubject weight in kg at test time\nkg\n240\n68\n111\n1.000\n79.97\n21.2\n\n\n 53.00  57.90  66.00  78.25  92.62  105.00  110.00 \n\n\nheight_m\nSubject height in meters\nmeters\n250\n58\n49\n0.999\n1.735\n0.1305\n\n\n 1.590  1.600  1.650  1.710  1.800  1.881  1.960 \n\n\nbmi\nBody mass index\nkg/m2\n235\n73\n219\n1.000\n26.41\n5.71\n\n\n 19.79  20.67  22.81  25.34  29.21  33.75  36.82 \n\n\naerobics_activity\nDuration of aerobic activity per week\nminutes/week\n308\n0\n32\n0.674\n48.89\n80.51\n\n\n 0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  60.0  169.5  240.0 \n\n\nresistance_activity\nDuration of resistance (involving weights) activity per week\nminutes/week\n308\n0\n24\n0.550\n31.24\n53.27\n\n\n 0  0  0  0  0  120  180 \n\n\nGlycine\nConcentration per Creatinine gramm\nμmol/g\n308\n0\n308\n1.000\n1051\n968.4\n\n\n 230.8  281.1  438.9  700.6  1109.7  1962.3  2881.8 \n\n\nAlanine\nConcentration per Creatinine gramm\nμmol/g\n308\n0\n308\n1.000\n649.7\n667.7\n\n\n 123.0  155.0  214.9  375.4  677.0  1514.8  2267.3 \n\n\nValine\nConcentration per Creatinine gramm\nμmol/g\n308\n0\n308\n1.000\n764.3\n1469\n\n\n 8.028  11.831  18.864  25.490  33.439  44.140  49.860 \n\n\nCysteine\nConcentration per Creatinine gramm\nμmol/g\n308\n0\n193\n0.947\n895.8\n1754\n\n\n 0.000  0.000  0.000  7.062  16.854  26.570  34.249 \n\n\nTaurine\nConcentration per Creatinine gramm\nμmol/g\n308\n0\n301\n1.000\n2604\n4041\n\n\n 74.76  175.31  405.24  741.15  1365.69  3190.54  4795.22 \n\n\nIsoleucine\nConcentration per Creatinine gramm\nμmol/g\n308\n0\n308\n1.000\n1194\n2314\n\n\n 4.269  5.558  8.600  12.935  18.512  28.446  41.480 \n\n\nLeucine\nConcentration per Creatinine gramm\nμmol/g\n308\n0\n308\n1.000\n616.3\n1184\n\n\n 6.325  11.086  16.289  23.416  33.225  47.868  56.610 \n\n\nGlutamine\nConcentration per Creatinine gramm\nμmol/g\n308\n0\n308\n1.000\n375.7\n257.6\n\n\n 99.52  127.40  195.83  324.60  495.47  701.16  802.99 \n\n\nGlutamate\nConcentration per Creatinine gramm\nμmol/g\n308\n0\n308\n1.000\n911\n1762\n\n\n 4.451  6.946  11.523  19.343  35.049  58.647  94.662 \n\n\nMethionine\nConcentration per Creatinine gramm\nμmol/g\n308\n0\n303\n1.000\n1036\n2025\n\n\n 1.072  2.000  3.293  4.602  6.123  8.570  10.197 \n\n\nArginine\nConcentration per Creatinine gramm\nμmol/g\n308\n0\n306\n1.000\n769.4\n1487\n\n\n 3.558  5.256  11.651  20.551  39.182  66.752  108.042 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRef_ranges_AAU_2 Descriptives\n\n\n10 Categorical Variables of 27 Variables, 308 Observations\n\n\nVariable\nLabel\nUnits\nn\nMissing\nDistinct\n\n\n\n\n\nid\nSubject id\n\n308\n0\n296\n1018 -\nNAKOS\nMin/Max/Mean Width: 3 / 12 / 5\n\n\nsex\nSubject gender\nFemale/Male\n258\n50\n2\n\n\n\n\nchronic_disease_flag\nDoes the subject have a chronic disease?\nYes/No\n308\n0\n2\n\n\n\n\nchronic_disease\nIf subject has a chronic disease, which one is it?\n\n308\n0\n50\n\n\n\n\nchronic_disease_v2\nRecoding of the chronic_disease information into more general types of diseases\n\n308\n0\n20\n\n\n\n\nchronic_disease_v3\nA lumped by frequency version of chronic_disease_v2 so that there are 7 categories of disease types in the data\n\n308\n0\n8\n\n\n\n\nmeds_flag\nDoes the subject take any medication?\nYes/No\n308\n0\n2\n\n\n\n\nmeds\nIf subject is taking medication, which one is it?\n\n308\n0\n106\nAcnotren 20mg -\nZinadol, T4, Nolvadex\nMin/Max/Mean Width: 2 / 44 / 9\nMode:None (n=201)\n\n\nsupplements_flag\nDoes the subject take any supplements?\nYes/No\n308\n0\n2\n\n\n\n\nsupplements\nIf subject is taking supplements, which one is it?\n\n308\n0\n78"
